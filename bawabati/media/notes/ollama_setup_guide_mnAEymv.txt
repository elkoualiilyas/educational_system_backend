✅ Step 1: Install Dependencies and Libraries
Activate your virtual environment and install these crucial dependencies:


pip install flask
pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-core
pip install langchain-ollama
pip install ollama
pip install faiss-cpu
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests tqdm

Note:

langchain-community, langchain-core, and langchain-ollama are essential for integration with Ollama.

faiss-cpu is essential for efficient vector search (RAG).

✅ Step 2: Install and Setup Ollama Locally
Download and install Ollama (from ollama.com).

Pull the Llama3 model from Ollama directly:

ollama pull llama3

✅ Step 3: Creating Your Own Fine-Tuned Model with Ollama
Create a Modelfile in your project directory (e.g., Modelfile):


FROM llama3
SYSTEM """
You are a math-solving assistant. Provide step-by-step clear mathematical solutions.
"""
Then, run:


ollama create allo_mathy -f Modelfile
Your fine-tuned model (allo_mathy) is now ready!

✅ Step 4: Running Your Ollama Server
Start Ollama server and keep it running:


ollama serve
✅ Step 5: Verify Your Fine-Tuned Model
Quick test to ensure it works (solver.py):


from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

ollama_llm = OllamaLLM(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:11434",
    model="allo_mathy"
)

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["math_problem"],
    template="Solve this math problem step-by-step: {math_problem}"
)

chain = prompt | ollama_llm

response = chain.invoke({"math_problem": "2x + 3x + 7 = 23"})
print("AI Response:")
print(response)
Run it:


python solver.py
✅ Step 6: Prepare Structured Data for RAG (JSONL format)
Create a file named math_prompts.jsonl structured clearly as:

json

{"prompt": "2x+3x=20", "completion": "Combine like terms: 5x=20, so x=4."}
{"prompt": "Solve x²-4=0", "completion": "Set x²=4, thus x=±2."}
...
Recommendation: Aim for around 50-100 clearly structured problems and solutions.

✅ Step 7: Set Up RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Create your solver_rag.py for enhanced accuracy and faster results:

python
Copier
Modifier
from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM
from langchain_community.embeddings import OllamaEmbeddings
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
import json

# Load structured dataset
with open("math_prompts.jsonl", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    data = [json.loads(line) for line in file]

# Prepare documents
documents = [f"Problem: {item['prompt']}\nSolution: {item['completion']}" for item in data]

# Split documents
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
docs = splitter.create_documents(documents)

# Embeddings using your custom fine-tuned model
embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model="allo_mathy")

# FAISS vectorstore for RAG
db = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)

# Initialize your custom model
llm = OllamaLLM(model="allo_mathy")

# RAG prompt template
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
Use these examples to solve the problem clearly step-by-step:

{context}

Problem:
{question}

Solution:
""")

# Define and solve a new question
question = "Solve for x: 3x + 6 = 15"

# Retrieve similar examples from FAISS
retriever = db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})
relevant_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(question)
context = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in relevant_docs])

# Solve with your fine-tuned model
chain = prompt | llm
response = chain.invoke({"context": context, "question": question})

print("RAG-based Response:")
print(response)
Run the RAG solver:

bash
Copier
Modifier
python solver_rag.py
✅ Step 8: Integrate RAG Solver into Your Flask Web App
Simple Flask backend (app.py):

python
Copier
Modifier
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from solver_rag import chain, db, prompt

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/solve', methods=['POST'])
def solve():
    data = request.json
    question = data['math_problem']
    retriever = db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})
    relevant_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(question)
    context = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in relevant_docs])
    
    response = chain.invoke({"context": context, "question": question})
    return jsonify({"solution": response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
✅ Step 9: Frontend Integration (Optional)
Integrate this Flask backend with your HTML/CSS (or Tailwind) frontend to send math problems via API calls (fetch or axios) and display solutions.

Example JavaScript fetch call:

javascript
Copier
Modifier
async function solveMathProblem(problem) {
    const response = await fetch('/solve', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
        body: JSON.stringify({"math_problem": problem})
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data.solution);
}

Ollama, the AI model is based on transformer-based architectures, which are a class of deep learning models primarily used in natural language processing (NLP). These architectures are widely used in state-of-the-art models like GPT, BERT, T5, and more. However, Ollama is specifically designed to work with large language models (LLMs) in a way that optimizes performance for conversational AI and knowledge retrieval tasks.

Key Algorithms and Concepts Used by Ollama:
Transformer Architecture:

Ollama uses the Transformer architecture, which was introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017).

Self-Attention Mechanism: A key part of the transformer architecture, self-attention allows the model to consider the relationships between all words in a sequence, regardless of their distance from each other. This is essential for tasks like text generation and comprehension.

Positional Encoding: Since transformers don't process sequences sequentially, positional encoding is added to provide the model with information about the position of words in a sentence.

Language Modeling (LM):

Ollama likely uses autoregressive language modeling where the model is trained to predict the next token (word or sub-word) in a sequence given the previous tokens. This is a common approach for text generation models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).

It generates coherent and contextually relevant text by modeling the probability distribution of the next word in a sequence based on the previous context.

Pre-training and Fine-tuning:

Pre-training: The model is initially trained on a large corpus of general text data to learn language patterns, grammar, syntax, and some basic world knowledge.

Fine-tuning: Ollama might undergo fine-tuning on domain-specific data (like math, science, or any specialized knowledge) to adapt the model's responses to be more accurate in those contexts. This process is essential for task-specific applications such as question answering or problem-solving.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

Ollama integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which is a method used to improve language models by incorporating external knowledge retrieval during the generation process.

RAG combines:

Retrieval: The model retrieves relevant documents or snippets from a database (e.g., Wikipedia, knowledge base) based on the query.

Generation: The model then generates the final response by conditioning on both the input query and the retrieved documents.

This hybrid approach allows Ollama to provide more factual and contextually rich answers rather than relying solely on the knowledge stored in its parameters.

Attention Mechanisms:

In addition to self-attention, transformers use multi-head attention, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, enhancing the model's ability to understand context in longer text sequences.
